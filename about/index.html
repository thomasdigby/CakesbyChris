						<strong>Passion</strong><br/>
						I have always loved baking, but it wasnâ€™t until my mid twenties that I discovered my artistic side and subsequent passion for cake decorating. What initially started as a hobby and a way to achieve inner contentment soon turned into enjoyment of making cakes for friends and family.

						<strong>Art</strong><br/>
						This allowed me to develop my cake decorating skills and prepare a repertoire of delicious recipes. I take enormous pleasure and care in creating edible pieces of art which also taste as delicious as they look stunning.
