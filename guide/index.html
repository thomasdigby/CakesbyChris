						<h3>Celebration cake prices</h3>
						<p>Celebration cakes start at £40 for a plain iced 7 inch round sponge cake (£50 for rich fruit cake). Prices reflect cake size and number and complexity of decorations. Sculpted cakes will usually cost considerably more due to factors like cake wastage, cost of internal supports and time spent carving.</p>
						<h3>Wedding cake prices</h3>
						<p>Two tier cakes from: £120
							<br /> Three tier cakes from: £200
							<br /> Four tier cakes from: £290
							<br /> Five tier cakes from: £390
							<br /> Personalised bride and groom toppers from: £50</p>
						<p>For an additional cost I can set up the cake at your wedding venue if necessary. Please ask for a quote.</p>
						<h3>Cookie prices (minimum order 24)</h3>
						<p>Cookies range from £2—£3.50 each, depending on complexity of design. Each cookie comes individually wrapped in a clear cellophane bag and tied with a pretty satin ribbon.</p>
						<h3>Cupcake prices (minimum order 12)</h3>
						<p>Basic cupcakes start at £1.50 each and then additional costs for decorations.
						</p>
						<h3>Discounts</h3>
						<p>Discounts can be negotiated on large orders (i.e. 50+) for both cookies and cupcakes.</p>
